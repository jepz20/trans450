Public Transportation App
Prepare for this project with JavaScript Promises and Building Offline-First Apps.

Requirements
You must build an application that allows users to select a departure and arrival
train station, and see a list of trains, times, and durations. Initially,
the application should load a default train schedule - many public transportation
 agencies offer this information via an API or as a GTFS file (for example, CalTrain
 (http://www.caltrain.com/developer.html)
 or the My511.org transit data feed(http://511.org/developer-resources_transit-data-feed.asp)).
If the application is online, your schedule
 should reflect the available transit data, informing the user of relevant information
 for example departure times and arrival times.

 for this project early and often.
